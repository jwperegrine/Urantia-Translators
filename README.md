# Urantia-Translators
A Urantia Book translators and revisers help tool.


The Urantia Book (http://www.urantia.org) is now translated (or being translated) into more than 15 languages and it is a huge volunteer work almost done for free.

If you want to read more about this process that sometimes could take more than 40 years at all for just one translation, read this:

Here we just want to give a small help to this big challemge done by our friends.
